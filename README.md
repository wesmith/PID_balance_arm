Implement and experiment with a balancing arm that demonstrates PID control, based upon
the project by Electronoobs:

I want to thank Electronoobs for pushing me over the edge to finally get a 3D printer
after watching this video.

For the 3D modeling, .blend and .stl files were created with Blender,
.gcode files were created with Cura, and printed on an Ender 3 Pro.
